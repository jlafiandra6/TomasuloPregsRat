Tomasulo Algorithm implementation in a processor using RAT/PREGS simulator by Jonathan Lafiandra

Trace reader by CS4290 TAs

To compile with g++ do:
    make

To compile with cc do:
    make C=1

In any case, to clean do:
    make clean


To run after making, type:
./procsim -r12 -f4 -j1 -k2 -l3 -p32 < traces/file.trace 

with file being either:
	gcc.100k
	gobmk.100k
	hmmer.100k
	mcf.100k

Extra Parameters:
./procsim –f F –j J –k K –l L -r ROB -p PREG <trace_file>

The command line parameters are as follows:
●F – Dispatch rate (instructions per cycle)
●J – Number of k0 function units
●K –Number of k1 function units
●L – Number of k2 function units
●ROB - Number of ROB entries
●PREG - Number of PREGs
●trace_file – Path name to the trace file
